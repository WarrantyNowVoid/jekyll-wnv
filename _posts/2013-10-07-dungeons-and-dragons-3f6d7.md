Wizards of the Coast has been running what they call the "D&D Next Playtest" for a while now, and have recently released the final update before the game's public release date next year. There are a lot of intricate new systems as well as ingenious simplifications of old ones, and if you don't want to be laughed out of your local hobby shop come spring you'll need to study up!

Or don't! I'm not your real dad, where do I get off telling you what to do?!

The most important thing to know going into D&D Next is this: People will not think this version is cooler than the previous ones. Much like having a Yu-Gi-Oh duel in a classy restaurant, admitting to normal people that you spend your nights as a Drow Assassin (who should seriously consider switching from Mountain Dew to water if they want their urine to go back to a normal color) is well within the realm of "judge-able behavior." You can try, as I have, to rope new folks in to the excitement and intrigue of D&D, but that is a long road through a dark forest; few have successfully navigated that route, and fewer still have had sex afterwards. Like, ever again.

The second most important thing to know about D&D Next: If you like it, you can never let anyone who's played an older version know that. The things you like are stupid, and you're stupid for having given them a chance.
