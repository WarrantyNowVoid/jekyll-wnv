excerpt: "They say that a haircut a day keeps the doctor away, but I would argue that that's entirely too many haircuts and that a psychiatrist should be brought in for a consult. I prefer to maintain a somewhat less frequent schedule of hair maintenance myself, but on those rare occasions that I do visit the local Supercuts I try to make it as interesting as possible.

Today a gay Asian man gave me a haircut from the late 90's. To clarify, when I use the word "gay" I'm referring to his whimsical and jubilant demeanor, not his sexual orientation. That said, if I had to hazard a guess I'd say he's probably into dudes. Anyways, the core haircut this man gave me was more or less exactly what I was looking for: uniformly short, but not quite spherical, as that would accentuate my abnormally lumpy skull. He did go a bit shorter than I had initially planned, but I think I understand his mistake. I started losing my hair about a year ago, so when I said "I'd like it on the short side," he interpreted that as "finish the job."

As he set down the clippers and reached for the scissors, I noticed that his hair was spiked. "How peculiar." I thought to myself "Here is a grown man with a boy's haircut from when Nsync still decided how the cool kids looked. I wonder if he thinks that's what I want."

Then he reached for the gel.

A piece of trivia about myself: I have never intentionally styled my hair. I have always been painfully aware that I am genetically predisposed to be "weird lookin'" and as such have never based my self-esteem on my appearance. In retrospect, this lack of emotional investment in the length and alignment of my hair is probably why I failed to say something like "No no, I don't want that," or "That's alright, just the cut for me today," rather than quietly giggling like an unruly child doing whip-its in church while he set about the final stage of his work. In a way, I admire his skill. With not more than 3 or 4 deft hand movements he managed to flatten every one of my remaining hairs save the 20-30 in the very front. He masterfully managed to convince these elite few to stand at a nearly perfect 90 degree angle to their respective follicles, where they now keep a stoic watch over the top of my forehead.

I call them "The Honor Guard."
