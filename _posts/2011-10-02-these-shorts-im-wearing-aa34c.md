I wear shorts when it's hot out because it's fucking hot out. What are you, twelve? You're not my real dad, I don't have to explain my actions to you. Now read on and understand my long relationship with these shorts, and why we've stayed together, even through years of adversity.

##### The Good

The fly is expansive, allowing ample and convenient junk access at the urinal. For those of us with large and in charge dangly parts, this solves a common problem of the men's room. For those, like Cwayne, who are working with subpar equipment, it would provide a more comfortable experience when searching down there for the elusive and tiny penis they are rumored to possibly have. All in all, a larger zipper makes for an easier time in accessing one's apparatus.

The primary advantage that they have over pants is that they aren't pants. And when it's between 80 and 768,000 degrees outside, pants are the last thing I'm going to be interested in. My delicate leg hairs require a certain amount of freedom, or they begin to revolt and destroy me from the legs up. They will accept the confines of pants in the winter, but only for so long as the pants don't encase them in boiling death.

I carry around a lot of shit. Not, like, actual shit. That would be weird. Mostly I carry around keys and phone and first aid kit and weapons and emergency waffle iron. You know, essentials. On average, these things take up a large amount of space, and ever since those mean guys on the bus made fun of my fabulous messenger bag, I've had to make do with whatever built-in options my clothing offers. In the winter, my coat provides a labyrinth of hidden pockets within pockets, in which I can store all manner of goods and materials, but in summer, coats make you look like you're trying to hide the fact that you're masturbating in public. And, since I'm not always doing that, I need a warm-weather alternative. These shorts provide more than sufficient space to hold even the least portable of zombie dismemberment devices, while remaining relatively wearable, and unlikely to become a major hindrance when running for dear life from flesh-devouring creatures. Or trying to make it to the bus before it leaves. Either way.

They're shorts colored. What more do you want? Wait, what? Shorts come in different colors?! Now you're just fucking with me, aren't you.

##### The Bad

I know they're called 'shorts' but it's supposed to be a relative term, and relative to pants, pretty much any length is short. These shorts, however, sometimes like to take matters into their own hands and become the missing link between comfortably long and awkwardly short. Take sitting on the bus, for example. There is rarely enough leg room for someone like me, and that causes them to occasionally bring out the stark whiteness of my thighs for all to see, instantly blinding the driver with their reflection in the sunlight, potentially bringing all us passengers to an untimely, shorts-related death. Shorts that are too short are a serious safety hazard, and this pair often finds itself on the wrong side of safe.

They have stupid retard laces on the inside that often get caught in the aforementioned massive junk access terminal, creating an awkward fabric-dick illusion. I don't want to be walking around with a string hanging out of my dick-area. If anything is going to be hanging out of there, it'd be my massive penis, to let all the ladies know where their next orgasms and children will be coming from. The laces serve no practical purpose. Drawstrings? What are we, savages? That's why our lord and savior James Earl Jones gave unto us the button/zipper assembly found at the crotch of most modern clothes.

They aren't pants. It's cold when it's cold.

##### Conclusion

They're pretty cool, I guess. If you're into shorts. If you're thinking about buying these shorts, well then stop thinking about something so retarded. I don't even know what brand they are or where they're sold, and I'm sure as not selling this pair to you, asshole. What would I wear to work? Pants? Well, I see someone hasn't been paying attention.

**I give them one half of one single pant.**
