title: "Your Tax Dollars At Work"
excerpt: "This isn't a joke, they actually did this. Well, the first part at least. In 2009 NASA crashed a rocket into the Moon in order to kick up dust and look for water. We felt that this was a perfectly legitimate strategy and honestly think it has much wider application."
