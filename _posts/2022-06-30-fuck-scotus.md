That's it. There's no joke.

While you're here, here are some good abortion funds in areas that are going to need all the help they can get.

- [Midwest Access Coalition](https://midwestaccesscoalition.org/)

- [The Yellowhammer Fund](https://www.yellowhammerfund.org/)

- [Access Reproductive Care-Southeast](https://arc-southeast.org/)

- [Indigenous Women Rising](https://www.iwrising.org/abortion-fund)

And here you can find local funds to donate to, or even use their single split donation tool to donate to 100 at once across the country.

- [National Network of Abortion Funds](https://abortionfunds.org/)

Also, if/when/how provides legal defense, advice, activism, and general "lawyering for reproductive justice."

Eat shit Clarence Thomas. Get fucked Samuel Alito. Go to hell Amy Coney Barrett. Go fuck yourself Neil Gorsuch. Blow it out (or I guess in your case if it's a beer, up) your ass Brett Kavanaugh. Sincerely.
