Welcome to the first installment of "Douchebag of the Day," because let's face it; some people are giant sacks of crap and everyone everywhere hates them. I'm pretty confident that even Jesus hates them, but hey, that's really not my call to make.

Loud upstairs neighbors. We've all had them, and we've all lamented their continued existence. It doesn't matter if it's a huge weightlifter bro, or a tiny Japanese girl; anytime someone walks in the apartment above yours it sounds like they're playing a game of "let's try to break the floor." I'm beginning to seriously think that landlords give out complimentary cement shoes and pet elephants to anyone that doesn't live on the first floor. These are also the type of people that have just discovered feng shui at 2 o'clock in the morning on a Tuesday, and decide "Hey shit, my energy's all off, I need to move ALL OF MY FURNITURE RIGHT THE FUCK NOW". They have no regard for anyone else's sanity, which is why they also play their shitty music on full bass all night. It's always shitty music too; upstairs neighbors are evidently unable to like music that doesn't suck and that doesn't have ALL THE BASS. I guess that means that at least the good music is reserved for us downstairs neighbors, so we've got that going for us.

TL;DR upstairs neighbors love Satan, the musical STOMP, concrete shoes, pet elephants, and bass. Probably in that order.
