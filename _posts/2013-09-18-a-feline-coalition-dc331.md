Did you guys know that acetaminophen (the active ingredient in Tylenol) is toxic to cats? They don't have a sufficient glucuronidation pathway of metabolism, shunting a greater percentage of it down CYP-mediated channels leading to higher systemic levels of NAPQI. Once hepatic glutathione stores are overwhelmed liver failure ensues, promptly followed by cyanosis and death.

In other words, they insides don't handle it none, and then they be dead.

The way I see it, there are 3 types of people who find this information useful:

1.  People who would seek to keep the drug stored safely away from animals who might be harmed by exposure to it. Vets, most owners, and people who are generally not assholes fall into this category.
    
2.  People who actively want to kill cats, but who aren't particularly enthusiastic about doing it humanely. Serial killers, cat-murder fetishists, and Russian teenagers on YouTube fall into this category.
    
3.  People who are pretty sure that the stray cats around their respective homes are up to something sinister. "Tree-Shouting Larry" and I are the only members of this group as far as I know. (To clarify: Larry shouts things at the trees; he doesn't shout the word "tree." In that scenario he would be "'Tree!' Shouting Larry.")
    

I can't quite put my finger on it, but I'm positive that those little bastards are doing some sort of conniving or possibly machinating in a way that can only spell my doom. I first became aware of it a week ago when, walking home late one night, I glanced up to find 7 or 8 cats watching me intently. As I looked around I saw something in their eyes that I hadn't yet encountered during my life as an apex predator (which I definitely, totally am): a quiet, confident hunger. I locked eyes with their leader, and time stood still. They sat motionless, as if waiting for some pre-determined signal to strike. I was paralyzed before them like a deer that's caught the scent of a wolf on the wind, but knows it's already too late. I had resigned myself to a quick and violent death when suddenly, for reasons I couldn't hope to comprehend, they scattered like leaves on the wind.

I have no idea how long I have been under feline surveillance, so I must err on the side of caution and assume that they've been watching me my entire life. They know my strengths, and they know my weaknesses. They know my darkest fears, and they know what I look like naked. Admittedly, there is some overlap between those last two. I only pray that when they do finally decide to take me, I can go into that endless darkness with dignity and honor.

Or it could just be cats being weird; I am not a cat expert.
