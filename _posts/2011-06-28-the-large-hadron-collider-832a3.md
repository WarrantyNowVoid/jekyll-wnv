excerpt: "Today's topic is the Large Hardon, er, Hadron Collider, a bold choice given that none of us know anything about particle accelerators. To those of you who do, feel free to angrily comment on any mistakes you notice. I assure you that we'll take them super seriously. I'd also like to take this opportunity to apologize in advance to Switzerland for some of the things we said. "
