I was brushing my teeth today and noticed that the mouthwash bottle said 'Fights unsightly plaque.' This got me thinking:

*   Can you even see plaque?
*   Isn't the problem with plaque that it leads to tooth decay?

And then THAT made me think about how vain people are. For example, if you tell someone that smoking is bad because you die younger, it's a leading cause of cancer, it destroys pretty much everything in your body with time, they don't seem to care. But if you show them a picture of rotten teeth and unsightly mouth cancer, suddenly it's a big issue! It's such a huge disconnect. Another huge disconnect is that people who get botox and plastic surgery think it makes them more attractive. My home town runs a local ad on TV with a song 'it's all about attitude.' Obviously, it is not all about attitude. It's about how you look! Duh! It just makes no sense.

Then there's the people with those cars that are rectangular prisms on wheels. They're just so ugly. Why would you buy one? I like those Kia Soul commercials with the hamsters. They claim 'its no toaster on wheels' or something to that effect. I assume they're referring to the Nissan Cube, but shall we compare?

![I'm like 90% sure these are all the same vehicle.](/assets/img/lol/disconnects_cars.png)

So in order, there is the Kia Soul, the Nissan Cube, and then the Scion xB just for good measure. And they all look THE SAME. Only thing is, the Soul tries to trick you with its slightly angled windows. At least the other ones don't try to hide who they really are.

But I digress. Let's get back to the real issue at hand here, and that's oral hygiene. NOT LIKE THAT YOU PERVERT. Shall we hop on the logic train? So the leading cause of tooth loss is gingivitis. The leading cause of gingivitis is poor oral hygiene. So not brushing your teeth = they fall out. And people let this happen! That's just disgusting. Go brush your teeth right now. And floss. Oh who am I kidding you don't have any floss.
