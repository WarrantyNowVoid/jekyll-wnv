Why do girls wear these things? WHY?! I understand that everyone has different taste, but some of the shit girls put on is just plain ridiculous. We have compiled a list of the worst offenses we could think of, in the hopes that educating the masses (that's you) will put an end to these disturbing trends, and thereby make the world a better place. Seriously, I'm like 88% sure if these all stopped, so would terrorism and world hunger.

First of all, rompers. These are just not attractive. I was going to put overalls on the list but really they are just rompers without the built-in shirt so it seemed like a waste of time.

I don't know if you're trying to look like you're pregnant and just shit your pants. But success on both counts.

Ugg boots with mini skirt or short shorts. People should know better than to take lessons from Britney Spears, and yet' Anyway, I'm not sure what these people are thinking: Its winter on my feet but summer everywhere else! Not to mention you're not even supposed to get the things wet because they discolor. That's a great quality in a winter boot.

Things with too many ruffles. Because I want to be a cupcake. Wait' people actually like cupcakes.

Monokinis. To pull these weird creations off you have to be really fit. And lets face it, the fit girls aren't going for these. Then you just end up looking like this guy, and no one wants that'

Jeggings. Skinny jeans aren't even a good idea. Make them clingy everywhere and you end up with a real trainwreck. Even without a horrific pattern you end up looking like a human sausage. Already grilled and ready to pop.

Hipster glasses. Come on guys, your grandma needs those to see. And hipster anything, really. Stupid skinny jeans, stupid hats, stupid fugly sweaters.

Whatever, I'm so over it.
