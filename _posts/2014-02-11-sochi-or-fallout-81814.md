To celebrate the 2014 winter olympics, weâ€™ve started playing a fun new game here at WNV called "Sochi, or Fallout Wasteland?â€ The rules are simple enough, the mediator describes a scenario, and the contestants have to determine if it happened in the smash hit, post-apocalyptic video game series Fallout, or if it is currently happening to a reporter or athelete in the very real city of Sochi, Russia.

Ready to get started? I know I am. Click or tap on the Answer panels to see the correct response. Let's get going!

### 1\. You are trapped in a room. You must collect 3 lightbulbs to barter for the parts needed to escape and continue with your other objectives.

> Every day is a [fight for survival](https://twitter.com/DanWetzel/status/430829086022569984).

### 2\. There are palm trees visible from your current location.

> There are no trees in fallout, so this is [obviously the winter olympics](http://www.stuff.co.nz/travel/destinations/europe/9666441/The-lowdown-on-the-upcoming-Olympic-venue).

### 3\. A dictatorial leader rules with an iron fist.

> Well, kinda. John Henry Eden had way less power.

### 4\. Giant fire-breathing ants infest the ruins of a city.

> No evidence of turboants in Sochi. Yet.

### 5\. Hungry, feral dogs roam the streets (and on occasion, hotel hallways.) Government-funded kill squads poison as many as they can, leaving the bodies where they fall.

> 100% Sochi; Fallout isn't anywhere near [this depressing](http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/olympics/sochi-plans-mass-killing-stray-dogs-olympics-article-1.1600417).

### 6\. Gay people exist.

> There are no gays in Sochi, [the mayor said so](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-25675957).

### 7\. The water is brown, sludgey, and incredibly dangerous to drink or expose your skin to.

> [And to a lesser extent](https://twitter.com/StacyStClair/statuses/430536725341798402), the Wasteland's heavily irradiated water supply.

### 8\. Ruinous monuments of a once-great and expansive empire tower above the dilapidated cities and barren landscape

![Fallout](/assets/img/lol/sochiorfallout8_monuments.png)  

> Sochi has nothing to build monuments to.

### 9\. The populace has begun taking various home-brewed drugs to escape their bleak reality.

![Sochi](/assets/img/lol/sochiorfallout9_drugs.png)  

> Drugs in Fallout are highly useful for survival, and everything is professional grade [compared to Krokodil](http://io9.com/5859291/krokodil-russias-designer-drug-that-will-eat-your-flesh).

### 10\. A deep void within the very walls of your soul haunts you even after your return to the safety and comfort of the real world.

![Sochi](/assets/img/lol/sochiorfallout10_despair.png)  

> Fallout is actually pretty fun.

That's all for now, we're going to head back to the harsh and barren wastes and attempt to eke out a desperate subsistence in the hope that we can try to forget what we've seen in Sochi so far.
