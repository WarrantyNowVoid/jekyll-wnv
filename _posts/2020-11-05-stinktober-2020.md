Inktober is a challenge created for people to improve their drawing skills and habits that's grown to worldwide popularity thanks to its simple central premise: *draw something each day in October*. The concept itself has spawned countless variations ranging from strict rule sets to fun themed prompts.

Of course, here at WNV, we're never satisfied with things other people are already enjoying. We have a deep, some might say pathological need to ruin everything in our own special way. And so, putting our own WNV-branded stink on Inktober resulted in the birth of <span class="sketch bold">Stinktober</span>. Loosely a part of the <a href="/januarink-2020-pt1"><span class="sketch bold">Perpetuitink</span> initiative</a>, the rules of <span class="sketch bold">Stinktober</span> are fairly simple:

1. One drawing per day
2. Each "artist" draws every other day
3. The prompt for each day is the previous day (and "artist"'s) drawing

Now at this point you may be wondering, "hey doesn't this set you guys up for a downward spiral into total chaotic madness feeding off each other like an Ouroboros of Idiocy?" To which we would like to respond, "Haha, nice."

So now please sit back and enjoy

<span>1.</span> For day one of <span class="sketch bold">Stinktober</span>, we burned almost all of the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/littlespookydrawlloween/" target="_blank">#littlespookydrawlloween</a> prompts in one go. Ah, shit. Uh oh. Well, uh, I guess for day two we can just use today's as inspiration and see what happens. That sounds fun and probably normal, right? Cool. See you tomorrow!

<span>2.</span> Well it's day two of <span class="sketch bold">Stinktober</span> and we're already out of prompts, so we're just going to keep using each day's previous drawing as the next prompt, kind of like a fibonacci sequence of nightmares. I think you'll agree that it came out perfectly fine and normal. Say hello to Otaku Borat!

<span>3.</span> In a shocking twist no one could have seen coming, day three of <span class="sketch bold">Stinktober</span> is less "prompted by" and more "a direct attack against" the previous comic. How will tomorrow's post handle this personal slight? Maturely and with grace, certainly. In fact, I'd count on it.

<span>4.</span> Some people might see this as <span class="sketch bold">Stinktober</span> already escalating to direct personal attacks on day four, indicating a trajectory that is destructive and unsustainable. They would be completely right; this is not going great! Uh oh!
{% capture caption %}Scawt{% endcapture %}

<span>5.</span> Ah. Well, ya got me.

{% include figure.html %}

<span>6.</span> Day six of <span class="sketch bold">Stinktober</span> and we're finally at the point where none of this makes any sense unless you've read all the previous days. Honestly, I'm surprised it took this long; our logo should be an ouroboros of self-reference choking on its own ass.

<span>7.</span> On the seventh day of <span class="sketch bold">Stinktober</span>, our descent into pure spiteful chaos accelerates as Pope grabs the controls and immediately tilts this nosedive towards hell itself. Now taking odds on whether this website even exists by November.

<span>8.</span> Is it just me or does day eight of <span class="sketch bold">Stinktober</span> feel a little personal?
{% capture caption %}Scawt{% endcapture %}
{% capture image_path %}{{ base_path }}{{ name }}8.jpg{% endcapture %}
{% include figure.html %}

<span>9.</span> It's day nine of <span class="sketch bold">Stinktober</span> and I'm here to let you know there's nothing wrong with being proud of where you came from. I'll be loud and proud, cheering on the Dickheads next week when they take on the South Side Circumcisers.

<span>10.</span> Absolutely nothing suspicious about a pleasant interlude on day ten of <span class="sketch bold">Stinktober</span>. I wouldn't be concerned, at all; I would simply let my guard down and enjoy a relaxing autumn respite.

<span>11.</span> Each year, the Great Pumpkin attacks the pumpkin patch that he thinks is the most vulnerable. He won’t pick this one. He can’t. I don't see how a pumpkin patch can be more defended than this one. You can look around and there's not a sign of welcome to pumpkin based demons. Nothing but anti-pumpkin sentiment as far as the eye can see.

<span>12.</span> On day twelve of <span class="sketch bold">Stinktober</span> we're finally back into the *spirit* of things, getting *frightful* with a real *polter--* wait what the fuck  
{% capture caption %}Scawt{% endcapture %}
{% capture image_path %}{{ base_path }}{{ name }}12.jpg{% endcapture %}
{% include figure.html %}

<span>13.</span> We've made it to day thirteen of <span class="sketch bold">Stinktober</span> and there's no way this is going to devolve back into the sort of thing that was happening before, that's for sure.

<span>14.</span> The fourteenth day of <span class="sketch bold">Stinktober</span> brings us our first merchandising opportunity. Who's buying?

<span>15.</span> On day fifteen of <span class="sketch bold">Stinktober</span> all I'm saying is that maybe there is such a thing as watching The Mummy (1999) too many times per day.

<span>16.</span> It's time for some celebrity stunt casting on a very special day sixteen of <span class="sketch bold">Stinktober</span>. Really makes you think. 
{% capture caption %}Scawt{% endcapture %}
{% capture image_path %}{{ base_path }}{{ name }}16.jpg{% endcapture %}

<span>17.</span> It's sort of a metaphor on day seventeen of <span class="sketch bold">Stinktober</span>, which is really turning into a whole new kind of thing now.

<span>18.</span> Please! Someone! It's day eighteen of <span class="sketch bold">Stinktober</span> and I need help!

<span>19.</span> You might confuse day nineteen of <span class="sketch bold">Stinktober</span> with something werewolf-related, but it's important to us that you, dear reader, know that it's not. This is just an extremely horny city.

<span>20.</span> It's day twenty of <span class="sketch bold">Stinktober</span>, why not let loose and enjoy-- okay well maybe not that loose. C'mon man.

<span>21.</span> Day twenty-one of <span class="sketch bold">Stinktober</span> presents us with a guy who really just needs to move on already.

<span>22.</span> For day twenty-two of <span class="sketch bold">Stinktober</span> we have a crossover event with everyone's favorite kids' show! Wait, hang on, what do you mean you don't remember watching this? I thought we all did.

<span>23.</span> It's a <span class="sketch bold">Stinktober</span> surprise on day twenty-three, shaking up the race in an unexpected way.

<span>24.</span> On <span class="sketch bold">Stinktober</span> day twenty-four, we have a very simple request. Just, really basic. Please.

<span>25.</span> It's day twenty-five of <span class="sketch bold">Stinktober</span>, and the consequences of the last few posts are becoming clear. I don't think my kitchen has always been this high up but I'm really enjoying becoming clouds. 
{% capture caption %}Pope{% endcapture %}

<span>26.</span> We're getting a little bit of perspective on day twenty-six of <span class="sketch bold">Stinktober</span>.

<span>27.</span> Day twenty-seven of <span class="sketch bold">Stinktober</span> shows us another victim of gentrification. Smdh.

<span>28.</span> It's day twenty-eight of <span class="sketch bold">Stinktober</span>, and you know what that means; only fifty-seven days til Christmas!
{% capture caption %}Scawt{% endcapture %}

{% include figure.html %}

<span>29.</span> We've tried to keep <span class="sketch bold">Stinktober</span> free from the political hot-button issues of our times, but on day twenty-nine our silence ends. We are firmly in favor of skeleton liberation.
{% capture caption %}Pope{% endcapture %}
{% capture image_path %}{{ base_path }}{{ name }}29.jpg{% endcapture %}

<span>30.</span> On day thirty of <span class="sketch bold">Stinktober</span> we're finally taking a look at the flyer we picked up from those skeletons yesterday and now possibly rethinking our position on this one.
