title: "Deleted Scenes 2"
excerpt: "The Rock (no, not Dwayne) is a classic film starring two classic actors in the roles of their lifetimes. I watch this movie on a bi-weekly basis, or whenever I have an important event coming up, like a job interview. This deleted scene does slightly change the tone of the movie, though."
