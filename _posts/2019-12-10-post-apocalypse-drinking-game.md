Well, it's all over. Everything they warned us about ended up happening. The planet is now a dessicated husk of its former self, governments and society have collapsed into a wasteland roamed by survivors who will do anything to cling to life. Resources are scarce and money is meaningless, value is defined only by utility. Might as well have some fun!

We've come up with a few rules to liven up your next pilgrimage across the blasted hellscape a little, or at least numb you to the horrifying reality that surrounds and permeates every physical and emotional aspect of your life on this new Earth.
