In the interest of full disclosure, a disclaimer: I am pooping right now while writing this. You may think that's gross and go cry or whatever it is little girls like you do when confronted with the harsh realities of bodily functions, but I think it's an absolutely appropriate way to write this review. I mean, I'm sitting in the very thing I'm reviewing. This is what we in the business call "investigative journalism," and it's the only way to do it right.

First of all, a major consideration for any men's room stall is what exactly your goal is. Are you looking for somewhere to get some business done and get out? Or maybe you're looking for a nice quiet place to write for your website while possibly also getting some business done. Or even, in the cases of certain politicians, you're looking to get blown by an anonymous dude through a hole in the wall. Possibly before, after, or while getting some business done. The reasons for visiting are many for these multi-purpose shitting-cubes, but the purposes of this review, we will assume that the reader's intention is simply to use it for its main purpose: pooping.

Many men's room stalls have similar locking systems, where one must turn the knob in order to extend the tiny door penis into the tiny, waiting door frame vagina which holds the door in place. This system is perfect for keeping the door's position constant despite stiff breezes or the desperate knocks of a stranger looking for somewhere to drop the kids off at the pool. However, the lock is not flawless; the door penis often seems to exhibit signs of erectile dysfunction, not being able to fully extend into the door frame vagina, rendering it weak against stronger forces. If your stall is the only one with the gloryhole connected to the boy's locker room on the other side of the wall, and Senator Larry Craig has 15 minutes to kill before catching his flight, the fragile locking mechanism will not be able to withstand the frenzied pounding that is sure to ensue. And I mean that in more ways than one.

While I generally try to avoid putting my naked man ass onto the same surfaces as other naked man asses, sometimes it's unavoidable. The men's room is one of those few occasions. After years of mental conditioning, it's easy to block out the simple fact that I'm touching another man's ass with my own via the transitive property. Usually it is. But as you may or may not be aware, men are not renowned for their overall cleanliness. A poorly maintained men's room might just be the most disturbing thing you ever walk in on, outside of that time grandma had her "special friend" over. Being the masters of our domain that we are, us men often find little time for such valueless things as disposing of trash in anything resembling a proper receptacle, or aiming. These are tasks that are easily cleaned up after by those we pay to do so. I mean really, why pay them if we're just going to clean up after ourselves, right? No. Men's rooms are gross and the stalls are no exception.

There is also the question of privacy. Or, more than a question, I mean total lack of. The door, in all its slight breeze stopping glory, always leaves gaps even bigger than the ones in Sony's firewall. So, pretty fuckin' huge. These gaps are often a double edged sword. As the poopist, you are often able to see most of the space outside your throne room, and that observation brings with it the realization that it is equally possible for any dudes outside to see you in action. As an aspiring poopist waiting outside the stalls or even passing by an occupied one, it's easy to accidentally see through one of these massive gaps and get an eyeful of pooping man, the image of which is difficult to remove short of some bleach applied directly to the optic nerve. The exceptions in these cases being if you are a man who happens to have a thing for watching other men drop Wonka Bombs, or one who gets all giddy over being watched while making a deposit at the first national bank of feces.

This also brings up another distressing matter. Some men hold nothing to be sacred, at least partly because their hands are already full. Some men just want to watch the world burn. And then furiously masturbate to it. In the stall next to you. While you're trying to play Angry Birds and birth your food baby. It's been happening for as long as there have been workplaces. Where now these men bring their smart phones and have the wildest array of boobies to look at, they once had to make do simply remembering what that hot new girl in Accounting is wearing today while they [defile the handicap stall](http://youtu.be/D0mVcuojydg?t=5m40s). But make do they did, and defile they do. The lowest common denominators of every men's room, and the common enemy of every decent, non-fapping man who just wants to release the Kraken and maybe look over Reddit for a little while, these men destroy the otherwise general peace of the men's room, and as such, the overall pooping experience.

### CONCLUSION

Men's room stalls are fine enough for the job they do, which is making it so that you usually don't have to watch your co-workers/classmates/random homeless men off the street take a shit. They do this job fairly well, unless you look between the cracks (It's a butt pun. Get it?), and they will generally stand up to any forces you're likely to encounter in a men's room. They do not however, receive my seal of approval for emergency zombie shelters, which is something important to keep in mind. If you can put the thoughts of what your neighbor is doing standing up with his headphones on and what exactly is the composition of that puddle that's a little too close to your left shoe is, the men's room stall offers a decent place to relax and play with your smart phone. Maybe you can watch a YouTube video, or play a little bit of Wolfenstein, or even write an article for your website. The possibilities are endless. Just don't fucking whack off, that's annoying.

**Men's room stalls get one hook on the back of the door that can barely hold your coat up out of six of someone else's pubic hairs stuck to the bottom of the seat.**
