title: "Dentistry"
excerpt: "Going to the Dentist is a pretty strange experience overall. If I wanted to pay someone to berate me for my lack of hygiene, I\'d just buy another mail order bride. Or at least I would if my mouth wasn\'t still completely numb and everything I said on the phone didn\'t sound like \"bbbbbhffffftabnt.\""
