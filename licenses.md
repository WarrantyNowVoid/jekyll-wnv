  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</blockquote>

  <ol>
    <li>Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't be a dick.<br />
      Being a dick includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:
      <ol>
        <li>Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy the original work/works and change the name. </li>
        <li>Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being a dick.  </li>
        <li>Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER dick. </li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work,
   share the love. Only a dick would make loads off this work and not buy the original work's 
   creator(s) a pint.</li>
   
    <li>Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching when it goes wrong makes you a DONKEY dick. Fix the problem yourself. A non-dick would submit the fix back or submit a <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html" target="_blank">bug report</a></li>
  </ol>
